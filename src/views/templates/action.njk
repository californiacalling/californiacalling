        <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the California Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins, and posters.</p>

            <p>We’ll be giving away pins and posters at our pop-up shop during the SF Design Week Studio Crawl on June 21. T-shirt designs will be available for purchase and we’re letting you choose what you pay. Proceeds will go to help the communities who were displaced as a result of the wildfires.</p>
